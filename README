Everything Works...I think. Read these notes for the exceptions.

*Tried using "vi" and "valgrind" as arguments. This caused some weird behavior.
vi prints a warning about the output not being a terminal and does not work. As
these are programs and not commands, I believe this functionally is outside the
scope of the assignment and thus is not a problem. (vi breaks everything).

*Also does not handle "&", "|", ">", or "<". I believe this is outside the scope
of the assignment and I have not implemented functionallity for it.

*"ls" prints out a single column. Not sure what to do about that. There are
new lines in the output, but I did not put them there.

*the "clear" command will clear the terminal of the client. I'm not sure how it
works. Not a problem, I just thought it was is neat.

*I made the assumption that no argument would be longer than 100 characters.

*"top" works (displays) but you can't interact with it. ctrl-C to quit


                             /*/**/ Client /**/*/
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Valgrind reports 0 errors and 0 memory leaks in every case test (see below).

*even when using commands like "yes" which have to be stopped with ctrl-C,
there are no leaks.

Error handling (exit with no leaks) for:
	incorrect input (usage)
	socket()
	connect()

No/minimal error handling for:
	free()
	malloc()
	read()
	sprintf()
	write()

return values
	0 - successful completion
	1 - wrong syntax
	2 - failed to create socket
	3 - connection failed

Valgrind reports 0 errors and 0 memory leaks in every case test (see below).

Error handling (exit with no leaks) for:
	fork()

	execvp()
	socket()
	bind()
	listen()

No/minimal error handling for:
	free()
	malloc()
	sprintf()
	write()

return values
	1 - a call to fork() failed   (process terminates)
	2 - a call to dup2() failed   (child terminates)
	3 - a call to execvp() failed (child terminates)
	4 - failed to create socket   (process terminates)
